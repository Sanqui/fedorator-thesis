A sincere thank you to my supervisor Miroslav Hrončok for his ideas, advice, and continued mentoring.  Thank you to Petr Viktorin for his ethusiasm and pieces of hardware.  Sorry I didn't reach out more!  Many thanks to Marek Žehra for incredibly professional photos on short notice.

Thank you, Sentri, for proofreeding as well as keeping me virtual company during the final stretch.  Thanks to Jiří Šebele for lending a hand, somehow we form a good team.  A thank you goes to my parents, even if they are unable to read the work proper.

Thank you to the communities surrounding open hardware for their worthwhile endeavor and always being willing to help.

Lastly, I would like to extend my thanks to birds.
