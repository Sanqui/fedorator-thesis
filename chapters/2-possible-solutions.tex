\chapter{Analysis of Possible Solutions}
    \section{Hardware Options}
        \todo{Write a few options.  I have done some of this in the positional report.  I have previously defined these options as FPGA, Arduino, NodeMCU, Raspberry Pi.}

    \section{Cost considerations}
        \todo{Point out the cost, how much money might be allotted towards building instances of the device...}

    \section{Ease of assembly}
        \todo{Who will be assembling it?  What will make it easy to assemble?  What are potential obstacles?}

    \section{Roundup}
        \todo{Include a table and short discussion over final choice(s)}

    \section{Concepts}
        Based on this analysis, I have created three distinct Fedorator concepts.
        \subsection{Concept A}
            \importsvg{concept-a}
            The first concept is a moderately large device which is to be used fixed in place and used while standing.  It provides an LCD with on-screen information on the status and progress.  The rotary knob allows for controling the menu and making a selection.  There are four USB slots present, each with a corresponding status light.  In order to be stable, the device needs support from the back.

        \subsection{Concept B}
            \importsvg{concept-b}
            \blind[2]
        \subsection{Concept C}
