\chapter{Analysis of Possible Solutions}
    \section{Cost Considerations}
        \todo{Point out the cost, how much money might be allotted towards building instances of the device...}

    \section{Ease of Assembly}
        \todo{Who will be assembling it?  What will make it easy to assemble?  What are potential obstacles?}
        \blind[2]
    \section{Hardware Options}
        \todo{Write a few options.  I have done some of this in the positional report.  I have previously defined these options as FPGA, Arduino, NodeMCU, Raspberry Pi.}
        \blind[4]
    \section{Component Options}
        \todo{Where can buttons and LCDs come from..?}
    \section{Casing Options}
        When it comes to casing, there aren't many options present.
        \todo{More options}
        \subsection{Wood}
            A wooden build would certainly look interesting, even if not modern.  However, because it would have to be handmade, it's not a practical choice.  Few people have wood crafting skills and would invest time in building the moderately complex case.
        \subsection{Plastic}
            Generally, plastic casings require ordering a mold, which is an expensive proposition unless an option unless a significant amount of devices is manufactured.
        \subsection{3D printed}
            In tech circles, 3D printers a common find these days.  A 3D printed case is only the matter of getting ahold of a printer.  There may be inconsistencies in color.  \todo{?}
            
            For a technically hobby project like this, a 3D printed case is the logical choice.
    \section{Roundup}
        \todo{Include a table and short discussion over final choice(s)}
        \blind[2]
    \section{Concepts}
        Based on this analysis, I have created three distinct Fedorator concepts.
        \subsection{Concept A}
            \importsvg{concept-a}
            The first concept is a moderately large device which is to be used fixed in place and used while standing.  It provides an LCD with on-screen information on the status and progress.  The rotary knob allows for controling the menu and making a selection.  There are four USB slots present, each with a corresponding status light.  In order to be stable, the device needs support from the back.
            
            \todo{Due to size of display and number of ports it needs Raspi...}
            \blind[1]
        \subsection{Concept B}
            \importsvg{concept-b}
            \blind[2]
        \subsection{Concept C}
            \importsvg{concept-c}
            \blind[2]
