\chapter{Interlude: USB Mass Storage}
    In the previous chapter, I have created a USB flash drive copier solution using the Raspberry Pi computer.  Thanks to the computer running a full operating system, all the details of the USB protocol were handled transparently and kept away from me.  However, for a solution closer to bare metal, this will not be the case.  In order to have any hope of understanding the problem space, I committed to study the parts of the USB protocol relevant to understanding mass storage.
    
    \section{Introduction to USB}
    
    USB, standing for Universal Serial Bus, is an industry standard defining the hardware and protocols surrounding connection and communication of electric devices to computers\cite{lifewire-usb}.  
    
    The USB 1.0 specification was introduced in 1996 and defined data tranfer rates of 1.5~Mbit/s and 12~Mbit/s \cite{hui1394}.  In 2000, the USB 2.0 specification was released, which a significantly higher maximum data transfer rate of 480~Mbit/s\cite{usb-specification}.  % \todo{did fast speed only get introduced with 1.1?}
    
    The USB 3.0 specification, released in 2008, defines a new SuperSpeed transfer mode.  This mode is claimed to support a transfer speed of up to 5~Gbit/s in full-duplex, with 350~MB/s thoughput in current implementations \cite{usb-3-hp}.  SuperSpeed plugs are distinctively identified by blue inserts.% \todo{USB 3.1...?}
    
    USB flash drives are data storage devices implementing the USB interface.  Many USB flash drives already implement USB~3.0 \cite{wirecutter-best-usb-3-0}, however, all have backwards compatibility as long as they use a traditional USB‑A port.  For our purposes, it's reasonable to assume people will use any old flash drive they have lying around, rather than specifically brand new ones.
    
    In order to create a device behaving as an USB host, I have studied the Universal Serial Bus Specification revision 2.0 \cite{usb-specification}.  Even if I won't be working with USB at a particularly low level, an overview is essential in order to understand behavior and judge parameters such as speed.
    
    The device I will be designing will only need to support the connection of USB flash drives to a single USB port, so only relevant information is taken in consideration.
    
    \section{USB Specification}
        USB is a cable bus providing data exchange between a host device (usually a computer) and several connected peripherals which may be attached and used independently.  USB defines a host-scheduled and token-based protocol for communication with peripherals.
        
        A USB system is prescribed as a tiered star topology involving hosts, hubs, and functions (logical devices).  USB allows for complex asymmetrical topology, but in our situation, only a root hub will be present.
        
        \subsection{USB Host}
            A single host is present in any USB system.  The Host Controller, implemented in hardware or software, has many responsibilities.  It initiates connections and manages all communication and bandwidth between software and connected devices.
            
            The USB host also supplies power to connected devices.
        
        \subsection{USB Device}
            A USB device is a peripherial connected to the host utilizing the USB protocol.  There is a number of class codes defined in the USB standard \cite{usb-class-codes}.  Common classes include the HID (Human interface device) class encompassing keyboards and mice, the printer class, the video class, and indeed, the mass storage class. 
        
        \subsection{USB Hardware}
            USB uses a four-wire cable, encompassing a twisted pair of data wires and as a V\textsubscript{BUS} and GND pair delivering a nominal +5~V power to devices.
            
            The clock is transmitted along with data using a clock encoding scheme.  There are three data rates available:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Low-speed, defined at 1.5 Mb/s with limited capacity.
                \item Full-speed, defined at 12 Mb/s.
                \item High-speed, defined at 480 Mb/s.
            \end{itemize}
        
        \subsection{USB Protocol}
            On the low level, USB functions as a polled bus.  Transactions, as initiated by the Host Controller, usually involve the transmission of up to three packets.  The token packet allows devices to identify whether they're the intended recipient of the packet.
            
            To faciliate communication, the host and device negotiate device endpoints.  A device may be composed of several independent endpoints.  Endpoints are simplex—data flow is defined in a single direction.
            
            A USB pipe is an association between an endpoint on a device and software on the host.  In other words, pipes are what the software handles and uses for data transmission.  Pipes can be configured to behave in \emph{message} or \emph{stream} modes, which either do or do not have a USB-defined structure, respectively.
            
            Pipes define a transfer type and hold several characteristics, such as directionality, the transfer type, the amount of bandwidth allocated, and maximum data payload sizes.  A pipe called the \emph{Default Control Pipe} is always present and is used for device configuration.
            
            %Data transfers over pipes are requested using I/O Request packets (IRPs).  IRPs will be retried under failure conditions, but three bus errors or a stall will require the host to recover.
            
            USB offers four transfer types for a pipe:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Control Transfer}: Simple request/response communication used to communicate commands and status.
                \item \textbf{Isochronous Transfer}: Contunious communication without guarantee for errors inteded for real-time data.
                \item \textbf{Interrupt Transfer}: Timely and reliable latency-bound communication.
                \item \textbf{Bulk Transfer}: Large and bursty, but non-time sensitive data transmission, utilizing any bandwidth available.
            \end{itemize}
            
            Understandably, bulk transfer is the type used for mass storage.

    \section{USB Mass Storage Device Class}
        The USB mass storage device class, or MSC for short, is a set of protocols allowing an USB device to enable the host to directly access a data storage.  A device implementing this protocol usually appears as an external hard drive.  All sorts of devices implement MSC, including hard drives, optical drives, solid state drives, card readers, or instruments such as cameras and mobile phones \cite{usb-keil-msc}.
        
        A number of subclasses and transport protocols is defined for the MSC.  MSC allows for certain protocols defined outside of USB to be used, such as SCSI or totally obscure ones like QIC-157 or SFF-8070i.  The USB defined transports are Bulk-Only transport (BBB or BOT) and the obsolete Control/Bulk/Interrupt (CBI) transport, only in use for USB floppy disk drives \cite{usb-mass-storage} \cite{usb-mass-bulk}.
        
        As of USB 3.0, there are provisions for a USB Attached SCSI protocol (UASP) protocol.  Particularly high performance mass storage devices may use that standard \cite{usb-electronicdesign-usb-uasp-bot}, but few devices have adopted it so far \cite{usb-winaero-usb-scsi-uas}.  In particular, as late as 2012, almost all USB flash drives on the market implemented only the BBB protocol \cite{usb-qemu-usb-storage}.
        
        %\todo{XXX that's not quite true, SCSI is in use **VIA** the BOT transport, and UASB is just anew transport in the next usb revision!!  Fixme!}
        %\todo{If I have time I should describe BBB/BOT...}
