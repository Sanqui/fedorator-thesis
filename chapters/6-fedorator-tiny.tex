    SO WHAT WILL I BE DOING HERE.
    
    Device dubbed Fedorator Tiny
    I began working with the Arduino Nano because I had it available
    I connected OLED and SD library.

    I quickly discovered there is not enough memory.
    
    Briefly considered ESP, but couldn't get the SD module working with it
    
    Decided the Teensy device will be ideal, especially since I discovered it has an USB host.
    
    There is an USB host library, sadly it does not support mass storage yet.
    
    There also exists the USB host board.  It has a mass storage library.  <-- YOU ARE HERE
    
    I made a prototype which copies an image from the SD card to the board.  <-- HOPEFULLY
